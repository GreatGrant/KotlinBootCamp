# Kotlin Bootcamp Exercises
This repository contains the exercises and solutions for Udacity's Kotlin Bootcamp course. Each exercise is in its own directory, along with a corresponding solution file.

Getting Started
To run the exercises, you will need to have the latest version of Kotlin installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

Clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:

`git clone     https://github.com/GreatGrant/KotlinBootCamp.git`

## Exercises
The exercises are organized by chapter, and each exercise includes a brief description of what it covers. To run an exercise, navigate to its directory and run the following command:

`kotlinc <exercise_file>.kt -include-runtime -d <exercise_file>.jar`

## Solutions
The solutions for each exercise are located in the corresponding exercise directory. Keep in mind that these are just one way to solve the exercises and not the only way. It's always good to try the exercises on your own before looking at the solutions.
